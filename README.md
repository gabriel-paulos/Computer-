# Keyboard Free Gaming 

Developed a program that when run detects hands/fingers that can be used to control a command on the keyboard. 

Used OpenCV library to create functions that uses Otsuâ€™s method in order to detect hands or fingers with precision in multiple light environments. 

Keyboard commands are controlled using Pyautogui and depends on where your finger intersects with the line.
